                <p>Blockchain is the underlying technology behind bitcoin. But forget cryptocurrency, this technology has
                  the potential to change the world as we know it. It may be a transformation as large as the
                  emergence of the Internet itself. See NY Times, BBC, Wired, and many more. Marc Andreessen has
                  called Bitcoin and the underlying "blockchain" technology a "breakthrough in computer science".

                  event is 5:00pm to 7:30pm</blockquote>
                  <p> The kickoff event will include a tutorial on the underlying technology. We will explore
                      explore blockchain technology and it's transformative potential; hear from blockchain experts, explore
                      different use cases and form teams to develop ideas for new applications.

                    Despite Bitcoin, blockchain technology has yet to achieve its "Netscape" moment that brings its
                    promise to the mainstream. In 2015, the financial services industry began to invest in blockchain
                    technology to reduce the cost and speed of back office processes. However, blockchain technology
                    can be applied to other industries, for example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Digital tickets for sporting events and concerts</li>
                  <li>Public records, such as land titles</li>
                  <li>Royalty tracking and payments for the music industry</li>
                  <li>Product tracking in a supply chain</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong> Collider Experiment Project to Follow for 4 weeks:</strong> <br>
                  Your team will develop and present your ideas to a panel of blockchain experts, explaining the
technology application, business model and demonstrating your solution via mockup or
prototype. This project is designed to lead to new ventures, new innovations with collaborating firms,
as well as project experience that can be used in the interview process for those interested in the
related industries.</p>
